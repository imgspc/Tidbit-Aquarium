# Tidbit Aquarium
## Watch them mingle!

Had some spare time at the office and thought about how I hadn't had a fun screensaver in a long time. I always liked the idea of an office-pet-sea-monkey sort of thing so I took around an hour and cobbled this thing together, using an HDRI of my office as the skybox to get a glass tank effect! For now they (the Tidbits?) kind of wiggle around after being randomly generated but the backend is in place to have them hatch, grow and evolve - Guess I'll have to come back to it sometime!
